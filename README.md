Igluctl is command-line tool, that enables you to perform the most common tasks with **[Iglu][iglu]** schema registries, i.e.:

* Linting (validating) JSON Schemas
* Generating corresponding Redshift tables definition and JSON path files for JSON Schemas
* Publish JSON Schemas stored locally to Iglu schema registries
* Publish JSON Schemas (or any other files) stored locally to AWS S3

For complete documenation on Igluctl please refer to the [technical documentation][technical-documentation].

## User Quickstart

Make sure you have [Oracle JRE 8][jre] installed.

Artifacts are attached to GitHub releases. e.g. 0.10.1 can be downloaded from

```
https://github.com/snowplow-incubator/igluctl/releases/download/0.10.1/igluctl
```

### Windows

`igluctl` is a single executable file.

To run it you can use following format:

```bash
$ java -jar igluctl lint $SCHEMAS_DIR
```

Below and everywhere in documentation you'll find example commands without `java -jar` prefix, which is Windows-specific.

### Mac OS X and Linux

You can run igluctl using following commands:

```bash
$ ./igluctl lint $SCHEMAS_DIR
```

## CLI

### Generate DDL

You can transform JSON Schema into Redshift (other storages are coming) DDL, using `igluctl static generate` command.

```bash
$ ./igluctl static generate $SCHEMAS_DIR
```

`$SCHEMAS_DIR` should be the path to the JSON Schemas stored locally that are to be validated.

### Publish JSON Schemas to a remote Iglu Schema Registry

You can publish your JSON Schemas from local filesystem to Iglu Scala Registry using `igluctl static push` command.


```bash
$ ./igluctl static push $SCHEMAS_DIR $IGLU_HOST $APIKEY
```

If you are running an s3 backed Iglu Static Server Registry you can publish schemas as follows:

```
$ ./igluctl static s3cp $SCHEMAS_DIR $S3BUCKET --accessKeyId $ACCESS_KEY_ID --secretAccessKey $SECRET_ACCESS_KEY --region $AWS_REGION
```

Igluctl will closely follow [AWS CLI][aws-cli] tools behavior while looking for credentials, which means you can omit `accessKeyId` and `secretKeyId` options
if you have AWS `default` profile or appropriate environment variables.

### Linting

You can check your JSON Schema for vairous common mistakes using `igluctl lint` command.

```bash
$ ./igluctl lint $SCHEMAS_DIR
```

This check will include JSON Syntax validation (`required` is not empty, `maximum` is integer etc)
and also "sanity check", which checks that particular JSON Schema can always validate at least one possible JSON.
